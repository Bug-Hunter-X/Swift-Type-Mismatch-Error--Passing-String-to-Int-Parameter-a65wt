# Swift Type Mismatch Error

This repository demonstrates a common type mismatch error in Swift, where a function expecting an integer argument is provided a string value. The example showcases the error and its solution.

The `bug.swift` file contains the code exhibiting the error, and `bugSolution.swift` provides the corrected version with proper type handling and error prevention.

This is a simple example, but this type of error can occur in more complex scenarios, highlighting the importance of robust type checking in Swift.
